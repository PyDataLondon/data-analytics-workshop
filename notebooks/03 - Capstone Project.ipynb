    "# Capstone Project\n",
    "\n",
    "After learning the basics of pandas, it's time to apply your new knowledge on some interesting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll perform some data analysis on a dataset of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can work on this project on your own, or in a small team (e.g. 2-3 people).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose a dataset that sparks your curiosity (some examples of public datasets below)\n",
    "2. Start exploring the data: attributes, data types, missing data, summary statistics, etc.\n",
    "3. Think about some interesting questions about the data\n",
    "4. Try to answer those questions using code\n",
    "\n",
    "Some suggestions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- working in small groups could be more fun and could generate more interesting ideas\n",
    "- think big, but be aware of time constraints: you can focus on a couple of simpler exploratory questions first in order to get momentum, and tackle bigger challenges later -- you can continue working on this project even after the workshop\n",
    "- choose a dataset that is already in a decent shape, e.g. in CSV (you don't want to spend all your efforts to parse some broken PDF!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) - movie ratings (suggestion: use one of the smaller versions, e.g. 100k records)\n",
    "- [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) - attributes about passengers of the Titanic (Kaggle registration required, you may find a similar version through a google search)\n",
    "- [Wine dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine) - chemical analysis of different wines (small dataset)\n",
    "- [Zoo dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Zoo) - attributes of different animals (small dataset)\n",
    "- [Flags dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Flags) - attributes of world flags and related countries (small dataset)\n",
    "- [Football data](https://github.com/jokecamp/FootballData/tree/master/football-data.co.uk) - historical football results per country and per year (massive dataset)\n",
    "- [US Census dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income) - extract of the 1994 US Census\n",
    "\n",
    "Other sources of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Datasets from the \"Python for data analysis\" book](https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book) - the repository contains the data for the book examples\n",
    "- [Kaggle datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) - Kaggle is a platform for Machine Learning competitions that offers open datasets (registration required)\n",
    "- [awesome public datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets) - curated list of publicly available datasets\n",
    "- [UCI Machine Learning datasets](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php) - collection of academic datasets that could also be used for Machine Learning\n",
    "- [UK Government Digital Service Data](https://ckan.publishing.service.gov.uk/dataset) - publicly available data shared by the UK Government Digital Service\n",
    "- [US Government Data](https://www.data.gov/) - same as above, from the US Government"
